scala-spring
============

Provides a template web project which blends the Scala JVM language with the Spring framework and the Maven build and dependency management tool.

 Maven usage
 -----------

- Build and run tests with:
        $ mvn clean install

- Start the webapp and view at http://localhost:9090/ with:
        $ mvn clean jetty:run

The webapp currently simulates the creation and display of an IOU.

Have fun,
Phil.
